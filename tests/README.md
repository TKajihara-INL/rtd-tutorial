# ORCA Unit Tests

The unit tests for ORCA are not installed with the ORCA package. Clone the repository to 
run the unit tests locally. The unit tests are written using the Python package 
`unittest` and can be run using a command like `python -m unittest discover -v` from the 
directory adjacent to `tests`.
