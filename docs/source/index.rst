Welcome to ORCA documentation
===================================

``ORCA`` (*Optimization of Real-time Capacity Allocation*) is a modeling toolset to accelerate real-time control and optimization of digital twins, including
 virtual models of facilities, physical facilities, and interconnections to allow optimal control of physical facilities using virtual models. ORCA is
 enabled by Idaho National Laboratory's `RAVEN <https://github.com/idaholab/raven>`_ and `DeepLynx <https://github.com/idaholab/Deep-Lynx>`_ software codes.
